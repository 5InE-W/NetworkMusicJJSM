## Dotsendline
4 player(can be less or more) setting:

- Each player choose a pattern position (without discussing with the others), where they will be crossing over the dots, before the game start. 
- one by one, the player should then use and symbol to cross the dots, for example using " - , | , \ , / " .
- every dots represent a sound, and they will be heard if it be crossed. 
- Still considering if the pattern itself should represent a filter or make some chances of the sounds.
